# hello-world
This is just another hello world project from me, a newbie.

I'm Antonio (from Venezuela) and I am just learning how to use GitHub because I was ignoring it for a long time. I know some Javascript things and a few of C. I study Mechanical Engineering and I would like to fuse my little (for now) programming skills with my career.
